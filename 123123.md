From May 1, 2020, Chinese nationals traveling to South Korea for business purposes may qualify for special "fast-track" immigration clearance provided they hold proof of a negative test for COVID-19 performed no more than 72 hours prior to departure. They must again test negative for COVID-19 upon arrival in Korea before being exempted from the mandatory quarantine procedures described below. Persons using "fast-track" immigration clearance are subject to standard government surveillance measures in place to combat COVID-19.

  

"Special immigration procedures" are in place for all persons arriving in South Korea regardless of origin. Individuals are allowed entry only after they provide verifiable contact information and an address within South Korea valid for the duration of their stay. All persons are required to install either the "Self-quarantine Safety Protection App" or the "Mobile Self-diagnosis App" on their phones and follow the instructions for documenting their health condition on a daily basis for 14 days.

  

**Special Immigration Procedures**

From April 13, 2020, all persons arriving from the United States (including Korean nationals) must self-isolate and must get diagnostic tests within three days of commencing their quarantine period.

  

**Symptomatic Passengers**

All persons (including Korean nationals) will go through diagnostic tests if they have fever or respiratory symptoms identified during the quarantine stage. Persons who test positive for COVID-19 will be transferred to a hospital or Living and Treatment Center (Community Treatment Center).

Foreign nationals who are short-term will be placed under quarantine at designated facilities.
