**"Fast Lane" Immigration Clearance for Chinese Nationals**

From June 8, 2020, Chinese nationals traveling to Singapore for business purposes may qualify for special "fast lane" immigration clearance. To use "fast lane," travelers must be sponsored by either a company or a Singapore Government agency, which will file an application on behalf of the traveler for a "SafeTravel Pass." If approved, the traveler will receive an official notification letter. Persons requiring a visa may use the letter during the visa application process. Persons already holding a valid visa may use the existing visa as normal. Persons who qualify under a visa-free arrangement need not apply for a visa to use the "fast lane."

  

For at least 7 days prior to departure for Singapore, "fast lane" travelers must remain in one of the following provinces or municipalities in China: Chongqing, Guangdong, Jiangsu, Shanghai, Tianjin, or Zhejiang. No more than 48 hours prior to departure, "fast lane" travelers must undergo a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test for COVID-19. Airlines will conduct pre-boarding checks to verify the traveler holds a valid SafeTravel Pass, a negative PCR test result, a return air ticket, and a valid visa (if required). Failure to produce these documents may result in a denial of permission to board the aircraft.

  

Upon arrival, "fast lane" travelers will undergo an additional PCR test and will be transported by the host company or government agency to a non-residential accommodation where they must self-isolate while awaiting their test results. Upon confirmation of a negative test result, the host company or government agency will ensure the traveler is transported to and from their workplace for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. The host company or government agency will further ensure the traveler installs and uses the "TraceTogether" mobile app for the duration of the traveler's stay in Singapore. "Fast lane" travelers are not permitted to use public transportation while in Singapore.
